## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- MTCNN for face detection  
- FaceNet for face embeddings  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification  
- Tkinter (GUI)  
- Firebase (optional)  
- Pandas, NumPy

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Real-time face detection and recognition  
- 🧑‍🎓 Auto-attendance logging with name and timestamp  
- 📁 Dataset creation and embedding generation  
- 🗃️ Secure model training and classification using SVM  
- 📤 Export attendance logs to Excel  
- 🖥️ GUI interface using Tkinter

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Use generateDataset.py to capture images of each student.  
2. Train the classifier using train_v2.py.  
3. Launch the GUI with homepage.py.  
4. Recognizer detects faces from webcam and marks attendance in Excel and/or Firebase.
